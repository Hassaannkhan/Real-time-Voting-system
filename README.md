Real-Time Election Voting System
This project leverages Apache Kafka, Apache Spark, and MySQL to simulate a real-time election voting system, enabling live vote processing, aggregation, and visualization through Power BI dashboards. It demonstrates the power of real-time data streaming, processing, and analytics.

Key Features
Data Generation & MySQL:
 Randomly generates candidate and voter data, storing it in MySQL.
Kafka Streaming:
 Produces and consumes votes via Kafka for real-time streaming and aggregation.
Spark Streaming:
 Aggregates vote counts, calculates metrics like votes per candidate and voter turnout.
Power BI Dashboards:
 Visualizes real-time election results and trends with interactive charts.
This system highlights efficient, scalable real-time data processing and visualization techniques.
